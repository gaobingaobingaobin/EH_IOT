The Piezo harvester was using a resistor of 7170 Ohms initially, and then it changed to 42200 Ohms because the load was too large.  If we find that we’re not able to see much on the Piezo still, we can increase the resistance (lower the load) further.
 
LOGGER01_FINISHED_20150527_1748 was at 7170 Ohms.  The other two files (LOGGER04 and LOGGER05) are at 42200 Ohms.
 
Solar load:          7.19 k Ohm
Diode load:        7.16 k Ohm
Thermal load:    7.17 k Ohm
Piezo load:         42.2 k Ohm (was 7.17 k Ohm in the first test, but I altered it)
 
The VCC and ADC reference (Varef) was 5.00 V measured with a decent meter and is correct to 1 mV (which is good).  The ADC is 10 bit, (2^n-1 = 1023) so the values go 0-1023 (which is 5.00V).  The value the harvester tries to get s 3.3V.
 
The volts per bit is worked out as Varef/2^-1, or 5/1023, so multiplying the ADC value by this gives volts.   (the 3.3V from the harvester board shows around 670 out from ADC).
 
From the voltage, P=IV. Since I=V/R, we substitute in (V/R) for I, giving P=V(V/R) = V^2/R.
 
Then we can sub in the expression for V.
 
All of this is done in the matlab script (broken into steps).  Just in case I arsed anything up.
